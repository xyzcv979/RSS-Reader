## Overview

### Description

This app aggregates all your favorite blogs and articles into just one app. There are alot of engineering blogs from different companies and people that I would like to read all in one location, my phone. What's different about this app is that I own it, so there are no ads. Also, I am caching the blogs into a database so I can still read them even with no cellular service, like in a subway.
